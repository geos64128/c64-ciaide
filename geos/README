COPYRIGHT
Source code of GEOS driver for CIA-IDE, installer and tools is covered by
GNU GPL license.
Specifically it means that you are free to modify it to other flavours of IDE
interfaces for Commodore or even other 8-bit 6502 computers but you MUST
provide source code of your changed version.


REQUIREMENTS/COMPATIBILITY
For compiling the stuff, you need ACME, a free cross-assembler.

You need a CIA-IDE interface as described in my articles elsewhere. By default
this source code expects that it can be found at $D300 I/O page. You can change
this by editing proper lines in inc/ide3.inc file.
This source code uses 8-bit interface only.
Drive: any IDE disk drive will be good. I have tested my code with a disk that
was not able to use LBA addressing, but LBA-optimized driver will be installed if
such disk would be detected. You should check your disk parameters. Installer
tries autoconfiguration, but it may fail. Wrong parameters mean wrong estimation
of disk size and possible loss of data. Cylinder/Head/Sector numbers are needed
also for LBA-capable drives.
Only MASTER device is adressed on IDE cable.


Supported platforms: GEOS 2.0 64/128 and...
C64/128 with REU
    - no problems.
C128 without REU and up to 2 different types of drives (e.g. 1571+1541 or 2*1571+1541)
    - no problems.
C64 without REU
    - memory expansion is required, currently supported are:
	+60K
	RamCart 64/128K



CONFIGURING
Edit config.inc and put correct machine value there (64 or 128)



COMPILING
Do: make
and correct .cvt files will be built and saved in compiled/ directory
Do: make clean
to remove all built files



INSTALL
Now you can transfer the resulting files to Commodore world and unConvert it
with Convert v2.5 or GeoConvert98.
Or you can use c1541 and geoswrite command to put unconverted file
on a disk image.

After unconverting copy auto-exec to your bootdisk and place it so
it would be between Configure and InstallDriveD auto-execs. If you are
not using InstallDriveD just place my installer right after Configure in
the disk directory.

If you don't have REU but you do use two different kinds of disk drives
(like me: 1571+2*1541) you will need my patched version of DeskTop 128 to be
able to get to drive C. It can be found at
ftp://ftp.elysium.pl/tools/geos_software/updates/

HDDTool is for configuring HDD and installing driver, it is an Auto-Exec
HDDSwitch is for changing virtual partitions, it is a DeskAccessory



USAGE
hddtool.{64|128} will help you to configure your HDD partitions and will install
HDD driver if necessary (it will be necessary on boot :).
Information about disk structure is saved in the very first sector of hard disk.
Read source code for more. Anyway, IDE HDD driver will not be installed if:
- there is no IDE interface
- there is no disk hooked to IDE interface
- disk is not configured
Therefore you must run hddtool for the first time from DeskTop to configure
your disk. Some menu items will not be available unless disk is configured.
The default partition is the partition that will be always set active whenever
hddtool is executed. The first partition has number '0', the last partition is
'65535'. Maxpartition in 'hdd info' option will show you how many partitions
you have. E.g. '5 partitions, 1 default' means that you have 5 partitions total,
the last one has number 4 and the second one is active.

hddswitch is a DeskAcessory for changing virtual disks. On C64 it can't be used
from HDD - store it on disk in another drive and run from there. It is not
possible to execute hddswitch from HDD on C64 because it would crash the
system.



PARAMETERS
Disk driver in its current state takes the first sector to store configuration
variables. The rest of the disk is divided into partition-like virtual disks
(called 'partition' over this document) that you can change while running GEOS.
Each partition has exactly 65024 sectors and 64768 are available for data so
there is 16192KB of free space. There are 65536 partitions available for total
amount of 1012GB (physically it would be 2024GB because of 8bit interface).
This is more than any ATA-3 IDE disk will ever have. Standard limits the size
to 128GB.
Note that you can't use disk smaller than 32MB to hold one 16MB partition
with 8bit interface.

Transfer rate is... acceptable (erm, I don't know the speed :). It works
somewhat better on C128 in 2MHz mode, it seems that much time is spent on
calculating sector data, however my disk uses CHS only and LBA to CHS
calculations seem to be long (32 bit arithmetic is involved). If your disk
supports LBA this is not an issue because driver internally uses only LBA.
Anyway it doesn't seem to be much slower than RAM disk without DMA
(e.g. geoRAM) and it is way faster than 1541/71.


DISK STRUCTURE
Tracks are numbered from 1 to 255. Sectors are numbered from 0 to 255.
Disk driver contains current partition size (now always $0000FF00) and
offset from start of disk to start of current partition. Within partition
layout is as below:

sector offset
$00000000	track 1, sector 0
$000000FF	track 1, sector 255
$00000100	track 2, sector 0
...
$00001100	track 18, sector 0
...
$0000FEFF	track 254, sector 255

Directory occupies whole track 18. (18,0) is the usual directory header, as in
1541. It contains link to (18,1) where file descriptions are stored.
Sector (18,223) contains GEOS border directory and the following 32 sectors
(18,224)-(18,255) contain BAM bitmap. BAM Sectors do not store link in first
two bytes - all 256 bytes are used for allocation map. Sector (18,224) has
map for tracks 1-9.
The rest of directory - file descriptions is identical to classic 1541 scheme.
There are 222 sectors for file descriptions so a partition may contain up to
4368 files.
